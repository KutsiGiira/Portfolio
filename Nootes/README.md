Nootes 📝

A simple note-taking web app built with Angular and Tailwind CSS.

📖 Description

Nootes allows users to create and manage notes for trips, information, and reminders.

Notes are displayed in a dedicated notes page.

An archive feature lets users keep notes visible in the main page while also adding them to the archive page.

All notes are stored in the browser using LocalStorage, so they remain available even after closing or refreshing the app.
